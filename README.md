## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Roza is a biological researcher in a microbiology laboratory. She is interested in bacteria that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef and she believes this is found inside the human belly button. She wants to build a dashboard with data of bactteria from bellybuttons sampled all across the country.

### Objective
She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
